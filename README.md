# Data Engineering Coding Challenge - Stock Data Analysis

## Objective

* Read stock price data from a CSV file
* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
* Calculate various metrics and generate insights
* Visualize the stock price trends using Matplotlib

## Example metrics and insights

* The open and close prices over the given time period
* Average daily return
* Stock volatility
* The maximum drawdown
* Moving averages
* Volume analysis
* Candlestick patterns
* Seasonality

## Instructions

1. Instructions for Running:
   - The solution should include clear instructions on how to run the code, including any dependencies or setup requirements.
   - The instructions should specify the version of Python and any necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib) that need to be installed.
   - If the code relies on external data files (e.g., CSV files), the instructions should mention where to place those files and how to provide the file path in the code.

2. Code Comments and Documentation:
   - The code should include meaningful comments that explain the purpose and functionality of each section or block of code.
   - Use consistent naming conventions throughout the code for better readability.
   - The code should be well-structured and organized into logical sections or functions based on the tasks or calculations performed.
   - Use meaningful function names that describe the purpose of the function.

3. Error Handling and Input Validation:
   - The code should include appropriate error-handling mechanisms to handle potential issues or exceptions gracefully.
   - Validate user or data inputs to ensure they meet the expected format and range.
   - Provide informative error messages or logging statements to help identify and debug issues.
   - Handle missing or invalid data gracefully

4. Performance and Efficiency:
   - The code should be efficient regarding time and space complexity, especially when dealing with large datasets.
   - Consider the solution's scalability and how it would perform with larger datasets or real-time data.

## Data file structure

The data file is a CSV and contains data with the following structure.

* Date: The trading date
* Open: The opening price of the stock for the given date
* High: The highest price reached by the stock during the trading day
* Low: The lowest price reached by the stock during the trading day
* Close: The closing price of the stock for the given date
* Volume: The trading volume (number of shares traded) for the given date
